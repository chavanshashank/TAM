        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="lead">Credenz is the annual technical symposium organised by the PICT IEEE Student Branch. Inaugurated in 2004, with an aim to celebrate talent, it has prospered to become one of the finest technical events in the country. Credenz not only infuses a competitive spirit among participants, but it also provides an informative edge through various seminars and workshops conducted by eminent industry professionals. Participants get to experience a diversity of events like Clash, Bplan, Roboliga, WebWeaver, Pixelate, Mad Talks and seminars on recent technologies. </p>
		  <p class="lead">The Student branch has always believed in encouraging students to think beyond the academic domain and challenge their potential. With the same objective in mind we aim to make Credenz bigger and better every year. The team changed the entire face of Credenz in the year 2009 when the entire event was hosted online due to the pandemic swine flu, which had made social gatherings impossible. Following the legacy, their juniors made Credenz’10 a great success. Now the PICT IEEE Student Branch presents to you Credenz’13 with an even wider platform to let students showcase their skills and talents.</p>
