        <p class="lead"> WORDS  ==>  Handle them Carefully, for words have more power than Atom Bombs...
              There is indeed power in words. Most of the lasting change that has been forged in the history of this world came not from a wielding of the swift and bloody sword of battle but from the shaping scalpel of ideas, and what are ideas without the words to deliver them? George Bernard Shaw had said that  "If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."                                                                      This is the event we aim to provide a platform to bring forth the ideas, where people learn, empower themselves and evolve to be winds of change our country needs.</p>
